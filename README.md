# Creating Honest Hotel Booking Manager

# Project Brief

# Hotel Booking Manager.
Create a piece of software to help manage guests, rooms and reservations.

# MVP

1. The app should allow the hotel to create and edit guest names.
2. The app should allow the hotel to create extra rooms.
3. The app should allow the hotel to assign a reservation to a room.
4. The app should show a list all rooms and their assigned guests.
5. The app should allow the hotel to check reservations out of rooms.

# Possible extensions

1. Add a date entry system to allow filtering of reservations by date.
2. Be able to distinguish between returning guests and first timers.
3. Add details to guests, including preferences, notes & memorable information.
4. Create maximum occupancy for rooms to prevent more reservations being in one room at any time.
